# Grafana
Grafana is the open source analytics and monitoring solution for every database

![Alt text](../images/grafana.png?raw=true)

## Hands-on
Let us open `localhost:3000`

Use the username `admin` and password `foobar`

Let us add the resource for our dashboard

We need to set the promethus server:
```
http://prometheus:9090
```

Let us set the scrape interval to be `1s`. Don't set it to 1s in prod, as it will overwhelm your service.

Check out the `request_count` metrics.


## Hands-on challenge

1. Are you able to create a dashboard to display the app side healthiness?
Hint: Search google about the 4 golden signals?
Hint: Could you add graphs for error rate, throughput, latency and availability?
Hint: If anything is missing, are you able to add it?

2. How do I collect metrics per host? What potential problem would you see if we have got 10000 hosts?
