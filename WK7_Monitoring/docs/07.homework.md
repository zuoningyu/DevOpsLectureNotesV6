Task: 
Your company is asking you to monitor its cloud application, could you come up with a grafana dashboard 
draft to show what would you like to monitor? 

* Directions to consider:
    * Where is the request coming from (region? IP? user-agent?)? Which host/container did the request land?
    * What is the throughput of the requests? 
    * What is the response time of your service on a particular API?
    * What is the error rate on every API? on every docker container? on every region?
    * Any saturation (thread saturation? CPU saturation? memory Saturation) observed?
    * How do you aggregate multiple hosts? apis? status codes?
    * Was there a deployment? Did it cause any errors?

(Stretch) Set up the P3 project in cloud and introduce metrics to monitor its performance.
