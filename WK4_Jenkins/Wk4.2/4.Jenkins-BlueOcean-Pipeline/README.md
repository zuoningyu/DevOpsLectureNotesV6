# Description

This is to demo how to build Jenkins pipeline using Blue Ocean interface

About Blue Ocean:
Blue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins based on a personalizable, modern design that allows users to graphically create, visualize and diagnose Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines. For more info please refer to <https://www.jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/about/>

## Pre-requisite

- Github Account
- Jenkins Server

1. Click "New Pipeline" on the top right corner.
Choose "Github" as the source.
2. Generate a token by clicking "Create an access token here" and provide the token to Jenkins.
3. Choose your account as the organization this repository belongs to.
4. Choose the repository you just forked into your account.
5. Create pipeline.

### Step 4: View your pipeline deployment process

You should be able to see all Build, Test and Deploy stage output.

### Step 5: Update pipeline configuration

In "configure", update the "Scan repository triggers" to every minute.

### Step 6: Create another branch in your forked repository

Create a "develop" branch in your repository, make some changes to the Jenkinsfile and push the branch.

### Step 7: You should see Jenkins pipeline automatically trigger the build for develop branch shortly after you push it

### Step 8: Update your Jenkins file and observe how that changes your pipeline deployment behaviour

Refer to these Jenkinsfile examples to update your config.
