# Container CI/CD using Jenkins and Kubernetes on Azure Container Service (AKS)

## Architecture overview

Containers make it very easy for you to continuously build and deploy your applications. By orchestrating deployment of those containers using Kubernetes in Azure Container Service, you can achieve replicable, manageable clusters of containers.

By setting up a continuous build to produce your container images and orchestration, you can increase the speed and reliability of your deployment.

![Architecture diagram](images/architecture.png?raw=true)

1. Change application source code.
2. Commit code to GitHub.
3. Continuous Integration Trigger to Jenkins.
4. Jenkins triggers a build job using Azure Container Service (AKS) for a dynamic build agent.
5. Jenkins builds and pushes Docker container Azure Container Registry.
6. Jenkins deploys new containerized app to Kubernetes on Azure Container Service (AKS) backed by Azure Cosmos DB.
7. Grafana displays visualization of infrastructure and application metrics via Azure Monitor.
8. Monitor application and make improvements.

## Deploy to Azure

### Create an Azure service principal

1. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you have not.

   > Note: Alternatively, you can also use Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal.

2. Open terminal, then execute:

   ```sh
   az login
   ```

   Follow the guide to sign in.

   > Note: If you use Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal, you are automatically authenticated. Therefore there is no need to ``az login`` again.

3. Execute the command below to create service principal, with the role ``Contributor`` and under the current subscription by default.

   ```sh
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <AppName> --role Contributor
   ```

   > Note: please replate the \<AppName> placeholder.

4. You will get a response like below.

   ```json
   {
      "appId": "8e897eb4-069d-40c2-9563-000000003c14",
      "displayName": "<AppName>",
      "password": "xxxxxvJgeKZoRAfxxxx0SitnANH8Kxxxx",
      "tenant": "000088bf-0000-0000-0000-2d7cd0100000"
   }
   ```

   Copy the values **appId** and **password**, they will be used later.

   > Note: for more details about creating an Azure service principal, please refer to [Create an Azure service principal with Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

### Create a SSH Key for Linux VMs

1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. At the top of the page, type SSH to search. Under **Services**, select SSH keys.

3. On the **SSH Key** page, select **Create**.

   ![Alt text](images/portal-sshkey.png)

4. In **Resource group** select **Create new** to create a new resource group to store your keys. Type a name for your resource group and select **OK**.

5. In **Region** select a region to store your keys. You can use the keys in any region, this is just the region where they will be stored.

6. Type a name for your key in **Key pair name**.

7. In **SSH public key source**, select **Generate public key pair**.

8. When you are done, select **Review + create**.

9. After it passes validation, select Create.

10. You will then get a pop-up window to, select **Download private key and create resource**. This will download the SSH key as a .pem file.

    ![Alt text](images/download-key.png)

11. Once the .pem file is downloaded, you might want to move it somewhere on your computer where it is easy to point to from your SSH client.

### Deploy

1. If you use Azure Free Trial subscription, please firstly upgrade your `free-trial` subscription to `pay-as-you-go` - `basic` tier.

   > Note:
   >
   > * Plesae do this step before continue.
   > * Otherwise, the following deployment will be hit by an `QuotaExceeded` error due to the limit of `free-trial` subscription.  
   > * It is free to upgrade and you will keep all your existing free-trial credits.

   You can click on the link as shown in below image to perform the upgrading.

   ![Alt text](./images/upgrade-free-sub.png?raw=true)

2. Click **Deploy to Azure** to start the deployment.

3. Fill the form:
   
   > Note:
     > * The names and DNS prefixes should be unique. To avoid naming conflicting, we strongly recommend you to add some suffix. For example, the `Cosmos Db name` could be `cosmos-180130-1512`.
     > * `ACR` (Azure Container Registry) names may contain alpha numeric characters only. A valid name is `acr1801301512`.
     > * Plesae select the **SSH Key** created in last step, rather than generate a new one.
     > * `Sp Client Id` is your service principle `appid`, `Sp client secret` is your service principle `password`
     > * `Linux Admin Password` must be 6-12 characters and have a good mix of lowercase, uppercase letters & numbers.
     > * `Dns prefix` must be unique, consider using `<service-name>-<appid>`, such as `jenkins-902d2aea-74dd-4f80-a0a6-7f6a976bb9b7` or at least part of it.

   * Choose a subscription.

   * Use a new resource group and choose a location.

   * Input the settings.



   * Check **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**.

4. Click **Purchase**.

## Access Deployed Resources

### Access Jenkins

This Jenkins instance does not support https, so logging in through a public IP address has been disabled (it would expose your password and other information to eavesdropping). To securely login, you need to connect to the Jenkins instance using SSH port forwarding.

#### Connect to the Jenkins instance using SSH port forwarding

1. Find out the SSH Key pem file path and replace the `<keyfile>` of below command.

2. Open terminal, then paste and execute it.

   ```Sh
   $ ssh -i <keyfile> -L 8080:localhost:8080 azureuser@jenkins-180131-1520.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ky3f+1oqa/nHzzLWZGf5TqiyZbJahoztoODcbobBGS8.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
   ```

3. Input **yes** and press **Enter** key to accept and add the ECDSA to the list of known hosts.

   ```sh
   Warning: Permanently added 'jenkins-180131-1520.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com,40.71.20.174' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
   azureuser@jenkins-180131-1520.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com's password: 
   ```

4. Input the **Linux Admin Password**

   If your pass work is correct, you will get the welcome message:

   ```Sh
   Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1067-azure x86_64)
