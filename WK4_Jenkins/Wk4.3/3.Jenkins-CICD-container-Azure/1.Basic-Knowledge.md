# Basic Knowledge

## Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

### Kubernetes Components

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a **cluster**.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

This document outlines the various components you need to have for a complete and working Kubernetes cluster.

### Workload - Pods

*Pods* are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.

As well as application containers, a Pod can contain init containers that run during Pod startup. You can also inject ephemeral containers for debugging if your cluster offers this.

#### What is a Pod?

> **Note:** While Kubernetes supports more container runtimes than just Docker, Docker is the most commonly known runtime, and it helps to describe Pods using some terminology from Docker.

The shared context of a Pod is a set of Linux namespaces, cgroups, and potentially other facets of isolation - the same things that isolate a Docker container. Within a Pod's context, the individual applications may have further sub-isolations applied.

In terms of Docker concepts, a Pod is similar to a group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.

**Using Pods**

The following is an example of a Pod which consists of a container running the image ``nginx:1.14.2``.

```yaml
pods/simple-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

To create the Pod shown above, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml
```

Pods are generally not created directly and are created using workload resources. See Working with Pods for more information on how Pods are used with workload resources.

### Services

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

#### Defining a Service

A Service in Kubernetes is a REST object, similar to a Pod. Like all of the REST objects, you can POST a Service definition to the API server to create a new instance. The name of a Service object must be a valid RFC 1035 label name.

For example, suppose you have a set of Pods where each listens on TCP port `9376` and contains a label ``app=MyApp``:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

This specification creates a new Service object named "my-service", which targets TCP port 9376 on any Pod with the app=MyApp label.

Kubernetes assigns this Service an IP address (sometimes called the "cluster IP"), which is used by the Service proxies (see Virtual IPs and service proxies below).

The controller for the Service selector continuously scans for Pods that match its selector, and then POSTs any updates to an Endpoint object also named "my-service".

> **Note:** A Service can map any incoming port to a targetPort. By default and for convenience, the targetPort is set to the same value as the port field.

Port definitions in Pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetPort attribute of a Service. This works even if there is a mixture of Pods in the Service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers. This offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your Services. For example, you can change the port numbers that Pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.

The default protocol for Services is TCP; you can also use any other supported protocol.

As many Services need to expose more than one port, Kubernetes supports multiple port definitions on a Service object. Each port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.

#### Namespaces of Services

A DNS query may return different results based on the namespace of the pod making it. DNS queries that don't specify a namespace are limited to the pod's namespace. Access services in other namespaces by specifying it in the DNS query.

For example, consider a pod in a ``test`` namespace. A ``data`` service is in the ``prod`` namespace.

A query for ``data`` returns no results, because it uses the pod's test namespace.

A query for ``data.prod`` returns the intended result, because it specifies the namespace.

DNS queries may be expanded using the pod's /etc/resolv.conf. Kubelet sets this file for each pod. For example, a query for just data may be expanded to data.test.svc.cluster.local. The values of the search option are used to expand queries. To learn more about DNS queries, see the resolv.conf manual page.

```sh
nameserver 10.32.0.10
search <namespace>.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
options ndots:5
```

In summary, a pod in the test namespace can successfully resolve either ``data.prod`` or ``data.prod.svc.cluster.local``.

#### DNS Records

## Azure Kubernetes Service

Source: [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance. Since Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure, you only manage and maintain the agent nodes. Thus, AKS is free; you only pay for the agent nodes within your clusters, not for the masters.
