## Auto Scaling Basics
### What is auto scaling?
Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of resources available to handle the load for your application.

#### 3 autoscaling methods for Kubernetes
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  * Horizontal scaling, which is sometimes referred to as “scaling out,” allows Kubernetes administrators to 
    dynamically (i.e., automatically) increase or decrease the number of running pods as your application’s usage
    changes.
  * With a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, a cluster operator declares their target usage for metrics, such as CPU or
    memory utilization, number of queued messages, as well their desired maximum and minimum desired number of replicas
* Vertical Pod Autoscaler 
  * “scaling up” sometimes refers to adding more resources (such as CPU or memory) to an existing machine.
  * While scaling horizontally is typically considered a best practice, there are some services that you may want to
    run in your cluster where this is either not possible or not ideal due to some constraint
* Cluster Autoscaler
  * “What happens when load is at a peak and the nodes in the cluster are getting too overloaded with all the newly
    scaled pods?”  
  * As the name indicates, it’s what allows for the autoscaling of the cluster itself, increasing and decreasing the
    number of nodes available for your pods to run on. (A node in Kubernetes lingo is a physical or virtual machine.)
