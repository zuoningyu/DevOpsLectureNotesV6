# High Availability
## Definition
High availability is a quality of computing infrastructure that allows it to continue functioning, even when some of 
its components fail. This is important for mission-critical systems that cannot tolerate interruption in service, and
any downtime can cause damage or result in financial loss.

Highly available systems guarantee a certain percentage of uptime—for example, a system that has 99.9% uptime will be
down only 0.1% of the time—0.365 days or 8.76 hours per year. The number of “nines” is commonly used to indicate the
degree of high availability. For example, “five nines” indicates a system that is up 99.999% of the time.

## The basic elements of high availability
The following three elements are essential to a highly available system:

* Redundancy
   * ensuring that any elements critical to system operations have an additional, redundant component that can take
     over in case of failure. We need redundancy to avoid single points of failure.
* Monitoring
   * collecting data from a running system and detecting when a component fails or stops responding.
     
* Failover
   * a mechanism that can switch automatically from the currently active component to a redundant component, 
     if monitoring shows a failure of the active component.

## Technical Components that can help with high availability

### Frontend Related
* DNS
  * Domain Name Server is the URL to IP address mapping and is the key for external customers to access your service.
  * In AWS, you can configure multiple DNS resources in case of emergency
    * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring.html
* CDN 
  * Content Delivery Network can hold frontend statics files and help fast delivery your content to your customers. 
    This service typically have good HA guarantees.
  * In AWS, you can configure failover to respond on CDN failures 
    * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/high_availability_origin_failover.html
    
### Backend Related
* Load balancing
  * a load balancer manages traffic, routing it between more than one system that can serve that traffic. 
    The load balancer can be aware that one of the target systems has failed, and redirect traffic to another
    available system, thus implementing monitoring and failover.
  * In AWS, you can use load balancer to help with achieving blue/green deployment to achieve zero downtime
    * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-create-loadbalancer-bluegreen.html

* Clustering
  * a cluster contains several nodes that serve a similar purpose, and users typically access and view the
    entire cluster as one unit. Each node in the cluster can potentially failover to another node if failure occurs. 
    By setting up replication within the cluster, you can create redundancy between cluster nodes.
  * In AWS, there are few things that you can consider:
    * multiple ec2 + autoscaling policy
    * multiple caches 
    * persistent queues
    * multiple  
    * multi-AZ
    * multi-region

* Data backup and recovery
  * a system that automatically backs up data to a secondary location, and recovers back to
    the source. This can be used to set up redundancy and failover.
  * In AWS, we apply https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html for RDS

### Open question to discuss
Although there are many things that you can do to improve your product, you may not be able to achieve everything in a
short term/limited money resources. So, which one do we improve first?

## A 5-Step High Availability Checklist
### 1. Define Availability Requirements
   * Identify the cloud workloads that require high availability and their usage patterns.
   
#### Define your availability metrics.

These can include:
* Percentage of Uptime
* Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
* Mean Time between Failures (MTBR)
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

### 2. Plan your High Availability Architecture

#### Start with a Failure Mode Analysis (FMA)
Identify the types of failure you might experience, the implication of each type of failure, and recovery strategies. 
Based on your FMA, identify the level of redundancy required for each component. Avoid single points of failure and use
load balancing to distribute requests between redundant components.

#### Consider costs
Remember that each redundant layer effectively doubles your cloud costs (at least for the period the redundant 
component is active). Ensure you have licenses and infrastructure to support the additional, redundant instances, 
including storage, networking and bandwidth. 

#### Consider resiliency
Ensure that systems can fail gracefully and restore operations without disruption of service. Isolate critical resources
, use compensating transactions and use asynchronous operations to ensure that if a component fails, business operations
can continue and be applied to a redundant component.

#### Replicate data
Ensure application data is replicated in such a way that supports your redundancy strategy and your RTO and RPO. 
It is not possible to failover or recover if you did not replicate fresh data to the redundant component prior to 
failure. 

#### Document everything
Document the steps that should take place—whether automatic or manual—to failover to a redundant component and recover
or “failback” to the original component. Instructions should be short and clear enough to use in case of emergency.

### 3. Perform End-to-End Testing
To ensure reliability you should test the system under realistic failure conditions. Use fault injection testing to
test different failure scenarios, including a combination of failures, and measure recovery time. 
Test both failover and failback.

#### Additional tests you can conduct to increase your level of confidence
* Identify failures under load
  * perform realistic load testing until a system fails, and observe how failure mechanisms behave. 
* Run disaster recovery exercises
  * conduct a planned or unplanned experiment where systems go down and your team must quickly operate according to
    your disaster recovery plan.
* Test health probes/checks
  * the load balancer uses health probes/checks to identify component failure. Test your probes to ensure they respond
    correctly in case of failure. 
* Test monitoring systems
  * periodically check that data from monitoring systems is accurate, to ensure you can detect failure in time.

### 4. Deploy Applications Consistently
#### Any change can result in failure
   When you provision VMs or other services, deploy new application code and apply configuration changes, the changes
   introduced could result in failure. Having an automated, consistent deployment process can minimize the chance
   of errors and failures, and help you recover more easily. 

#### Consider availability in your release process
   Design your release process to enable updates with minimum disruption of service—try to achieve rolling updates
   that do not require downtime of critical components. You can use blue-green releases or similar strategies
   to have several versions of your production environment available simultaneously and switch between them to move to
   a new version.

#### Plan for rollback
   Design a rollback process that can help you automatically restore systems to a previous working version. 
   Deployments should be automated to allow you to spin up a complete environment representing your “last known good” 
   configuration.

### 5. Monitor Application Health
#### Use probes and check functions to detect failure in time
   Detecting failures in time is critical to high availability. Implement health probes/checks and use check functions
   to get fresh data about service availability. You should always aim to run check functions from outside an
   application. 
#### Watch degrading health metrics
   Don’t only pay attention to complete failure. Degrading health metrics can provide a warning signal that failure is
   about to happen. Create an early warning system by identifying key indicators of application health and alerting
   operators when a system reaches a problematic threshold value.
#### Leverage logging and auditing
   Leverage Azure’s extensive logging and auditing capabilities: use semantic and asynchronous logging, separate
   application logs from audit logs and measure remote call statistics such as latency, throughput and percentage of
   errors.
#### Know your limits
   If you go over the allowed limits of one of your services, you may experience failures. Ensure you are aware of the
   storage, compute, throughput and other limitations of each service you use, monitor for the limited metrics and act
   before you go into overage.
