# Developing inside a Container - Setup a Minimal Docker Dev Env with VSCODE

## Goal: Run Visual Studio Code in a Docker Container

By the end of this doc, you should be able to develop your website inside a container and hook it to your external
broswer. Here is what looks like in the end:

### Prerequisite 
Install VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

### Steps
### 1.validate installation 
The green icon indicates your extension is installed correctly

### 2.Open the project
Hit Open, find docker-intro folder and open it

You should be able to see your local dev environment but this is not what we need atm.

### 3.attach to a running container 

If your container stopped, try spin it back up via your terminal
```
docker run --rm -p 80:5000 --name webapp_1 myimage:1.0
```
and then in VSCode, click the green icon and then select the second option "Attach to Running Containers"

and select webapp_1

Note: click yes/allow/agree for any permission pop-up windows 

### 4. open folder in container
Again, hit the green icon, and select "open folder in container"


You should now see something like the following:

![Alt text](images/connected.png?raw=true)

This means that your container is connected


### 5. show container logs
Again, hit the green icon, and select "show container logs"

![Alt text](images/container_logs.png?raw=true)

Now, you should see the terminal, container logs etc.

Congrats that you are in the container now


### 6. open a terminal and run the python app from the container
Open another terminal in VSCode by clicking "+" when TERMINAL tab is open
Type "python src/app.py"

![Alt text](images/run_python_in_docker.png?raw=true)

Now open "localhost:5000", you should be able to see the dev version of your app that runs in the container

Now open "localhost", you should be able to see the original docker app

### 7. making change in dev version will not affect the original version
Now open template -> index.html and modify line 6 to any color (e.g. red)

Re-open "localhost:5000"
Re-open "localhost"

Do you see the differences?
