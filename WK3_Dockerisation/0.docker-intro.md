## What is Docker?
* Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in
packages called containers.
  
* Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files;

* Large web deployments like Google and Twitter, and platform providers such as Heroku run on container technology, 
  at a scale of hundreds of thousands or even millions of containers.

## Why Docker?
Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient 
container, which is easily distributable and can run virtually anywhere.

Docker has been designed in a way that it can be incorporated into most DevOps applications, including Puppet, Chef, 
Vagrant, Ansible and many more, or it can be used on its own to manage development environments.

### Key Benefits

* Portable deployment across machines.
  * If you sent me a copy of your application installed in a custom LXC configuration, the app will be tied to your 
    machine’s specific configuration: networking, storage, logging, etc. 
  * Instead, Docker defines an abstraction for these machine-specific settings.

* Application-centric. 
  * Docker is optimized for the deployment of applications, as opposed to machines. This is reflected in its API, 
    user interface, design philosophy and documentation.

* Automatic build. 
  * Docker includes a tool for developers to automatically assemble a container from their source code, with full 
    control over application dependencies, build tools, packaging etc. They are free to use make, maven, chef, puppet, 
    salt, Debian packages, RPMs, source tarballs, or any combination of the above, regardless of the configuration of
    the machines.

* Versioning. 
  * Docker includes git-like capabilities for tracking successive versions of a container, inspecting the 
  diff between versions, committing new versions, rolling back etc.

* Component re-use
  * Any container can be used as a parent image to create more specialized components.
    
* Sharing.
  * Docker has access to a public registry on Docker Hub where thousands of people have uploaded useful images: 
    anything from Redis, CouchDB, PostgreSQL to IRC bouncers to Rails app servers to Hadoop to base images for various
    Linux distros. The registry also includes an official “standard library” of useful containers maintained by the 
    Docker team. The registry itself is open-source, so anyone can deploy their own registry to store and transfer 
    private containers, for internal server deployments for example.
* Tool Ecosystem
  * Great Integration Capabilities with pretty much everything that you can think of.

## I) Docker CLI
It is a command line interface client for interacting with the Docker daemon. It greatly simplifies how you manage container
instances and is one of the key reasons why developers love using Docker.

### What can docker CLI do?
![Alt text](images/Docker_Engine.png?raw=true)

### Three Major Use-Cases
### 1. Build
Build an image from the Dockerfile in the
`docker-intro` directory and tag the image
```
docker build -t myimage:1.0 .
```

List all images that are locally stored with
the Docker Engine
```
docker image ls
```

(Optional) Delete an image from the local image store
```
docker image rm myimage:1.0
```

### 2. Run 
Run a container from the myimage version 1.0
image, name the running container
“web” and expose port 80 externally,
mapped to port 5000 inside the container.
```
docker run -p 80:5000 --name webapp_1 myimage:1.0
```
or
```
docker run -d --rm -p 80:5000 --name webapp_1 myimage:1.0
```
Now, open your browser, type "localhost" and hit enter

Stop a running container through SIGTERM
```
docker stop webapp_1
```

Stop a running container through SIGKILL
```
docker kill webapp_1
```

Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC) for SIGTERM vs SIGKILL

List the running containers (add -a to include stopped containers)
```
docker ps
```

Delete all running and stopped containers
```
docker container rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

Print the last 100 lines of a container’s logs
```
docker logs --tail 100 webapp_1
```

### 3. Share
Pull an image from a registry
```
docker pull myimage:1.0
```

Retag a local image with a new image name
and tag
```
docker tag myimage:1.0 myrepo/myimage:2.0
```

Push an image to a registry
```
docker push myrepo/myimage:2.0
```

## II) Dockerfile
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document 
that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can
create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

```
docker build .
docker build -f /path/to/a/Dockerfile .
docker build -t ywang/myapp .
```

### Common Dockerfile Commands
#### FROM
The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions. As such, a valid
Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction. The image can be any valid image – it is especially easy to start by
pulling an image from the Public Repositories.

```
FROM <image>[:<tag>] 

## Examples
FROM node:latest
```

#### ENV
The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.

```
ENV <key>=<value> ...

## Examples
ENV DIRPATH=/path
WORKDIR $DIRPATH/$DIRNAME
```

#### WORKDIR
The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow
it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

```
WORKDIR /path/to/workdir

## Examples
WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR b
RUN pwd

ENV DIRPATH=/path
WORKDIR $DIRPATH/$DIRNAME
RUN pwd
```

#### COPY
The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the
path <dest>.
```
COPY <src>... <dest>
COPY ["<src>",... "<dest>"] # required for path with whitespace

## Examples
COPY test.txt relativeDir/ ##relative to the WORKDIR e.g. <WORKDIR>/relativeDir/
COPY test.txt /absoluteDir/
```

#### RUN
The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 
The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

```
RUN <command> ## Shell form, default to /bin/sh -c for linux
RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] ## Exec form

## Examples
RUN /bin/bash -c 'source $HOME/.bashrc; echo $HOME'
RUN ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo hello"]
RUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make
RUN yarn install --production
```

#### EXPOSE
The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. You can 
specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

```
EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]

## Examples
EXPOSE 80/udp
EXPOSE 8080
```

#### ENTRYPOINT
An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.

```
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
```

##### Example 1
You can use the exec form of ENTRYPOINT to set fairly stable default commands and arguments and then use either 
form of CMD to set additional defaults that are more likely to be changed.
Let us consider this `dockerfile_entrypoint`
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"]
CMD ["-c"]
```
Build it first with 

```
docker build -t top -f dockerfile_entrypoint_1 .
```

You can override the CMD with -H
```
docker run -it --rm --name test  top -H
```
Open another tab to examine the result further, you can use docker exec and you will only see PID 1 is occupied with
`top -b -H` rather than `top -b -c`:
```
docker exec -it test ps aux
```
You can easily and gracefully stop everything with
```
docker stop test
```

##### Example 2
But the following shell form `dockerfile_entrypoint_2` will not allow you to override
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT exec top -b
CMD -c
```
Build and run it
```
docker build -t top -f dockerfile_entrypoint_2 .
docker run -it --rm --name test top -H
```
You cannot override the command and the `-c` will not be attached, check with this command:
```
docker exec -it test ps aux
```

But this can also be gracefully stopped in another tab with
```
docker stop test
```
because the PID 1 is still our executable command

##### Example 3
If you forget about `exec` in the shell form
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT exec top -b
CMD -c
```
Build and run it
```
docker build -t top -f dockerfile_entrypoint_3 .
docker run -it --rm --name test top -H
```
check with this command:
```
docker exec -it test ps aux
```
the `top -b` is no longer `PID 1` 

If you then run `docker stop test`, the container will not exit cleanly - the stop command will be forced to send
a `SIGKILL` after the timeout:

#### Understand how CMD and ENTRYPOINT
Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions define what command gets executed when running a container. 
There are few rules that describe their co-operation.

* Dockerfile should specify at least one of CMD or ENTRYPOINT commands.

* ENTRYPOINT should be defined when using the container as an executable.

* CMD should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an ENTRYPOINT command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.

* CMD will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.

## III) docker-compose.yml file
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to
configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
