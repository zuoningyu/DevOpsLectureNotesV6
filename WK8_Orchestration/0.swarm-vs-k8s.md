# What is Kubernetes (K8s) ?
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that
facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes 
services, support, and tools are widely available.


# History
![Alt text](images/container_evolution.svg?raw=true)
* __Traditional deployment era__: Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to 
  define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues.

* __Virtualized deployment era__: As a solution, virtualization was introduced. It allows you to run multiple Virtual 
  Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. Virtualization allows applications to be isolated between VMs 
  and provides a level of security as the information of one application cannot be freely accessed by another
  application.
  
* __Container deployment era__: Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the 
  Operating System (OS) among the applications. Therefore, containers are considered lightweight.

# Why you need Kubernetes and what it can doï¼Ÿ
Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a __production__ environment, you need to manage the
containers that run the applications and ensure that there is __no downtime__. For example, if a container goes down, 
another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems __resiliently__.

Kubernetes provides:
* Service discovery and load balancing
  * Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is
    high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
* Storage orchestration 
  * Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, 
    public cloud providers, and more.
* Automated rollouts and rollbacks 
  * You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual 
    state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers
    for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container.
* Automatic bin packing
  * You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how
    much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use
    of your resources.
* Self-healing
  * Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your 
    user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
* Secret and configuration management
  * Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. 
    You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and
    without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.
    
# Know the components

## Pod
A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker), 
and some shared resources for those containers.

Those resources include:

* Shared storage, as Volumes
* Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
* Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and can contain different application containers which are 
relatively tightly coupled.

## Node 
A Pod always runs on a Node. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine,
depending on the cluster.

Each Node is managed by the control plane. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes control plane automatically
handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster. The control plane's automatic scheduling takes into account
the available resources on each Node.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

* Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the Node; it manages the
  Pods and the containers running on a machine. 
* A container runtime (like Docker) responsible for pulling the container image from a registry, unpacking the 
  container, and running the application.

### kubelet
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

### kube-proxy
kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes.

### Container runtime
The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.
Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and any implementation of the Kubernetes
CRI (Container Runtime Interface).



## Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. 
Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload.

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. 
* In production environments, the control plane usually 
  * runs across multiple computers and a cluster
  * usually runs multiple nodes
  
  providing fault-tolerance and high availability.

## Control Plane
![Alt text](images/components-of-kubernetes.svg?raw=true)

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting
and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically 
start all control plane components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.

### kube-apiserver
The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the
front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

### etcd
Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

Ref: https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/demo/

### kube-scheduler
Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run
on.

### kube-controller-manager
Control plane component that runs controller processes.


### cloud-controller-manager
A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you
link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud 
platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider. If you are running
Kubernetes on your own premises, or in a learning environment inside your own PC, the cluster does not have a cloud
controller manager.


## Deployment

Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your containerized applications on top of it. 
To do so, you create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration. The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create
and update instances of your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes control plane schedules the
application instances included in that Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.




Note: be careful with the price of Kubernete clusters, use price calculator to do an estimate


# Swarm
Current versions of Docker include swarm mode for natively managing a cluster of Docker Engines called a swarm. 
Use the Docker CLI to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm behavior.
