# Description

This is to show how we can deploy an application deployed by ourselves.

# Tasks
## Task #1: Build a docker image and push it to docker hub.
See: https://github.com/JiangRenDevOps/DevOpsLectureNotes/blob/master/WK4-Virtualization-Containerization-and-orchestration/4.docker-registry.md


## Task #2: Create a DB service (Not proper way. Ideally we should use managed database)
### Step 1: Click deploy to deploy an application.

### Step 7: Use default 27017 port for mongodb and expose.

### Step 8: When the service is ready, you will get external endpoints. Please choose "Cluster IP" as service type as we don't want to expose the service to public internet. The DB should only be used by an app.

## Task #4: Create an application service 
### Step 1: Click deploy to deploy an application.

### Step 2: Use your image in docker hub. Here I use "davisliu/todoapp" which is a sample todolist app.

### Step 3: Create a deployment as usual.

### Step 4: Expose the deployment as usual. You can refer to the below link.
Please use `8080` as target port if the webserver in your image uses port `8080`.

### Step 5: You should be able to see the below app if you use my sample image. Or your website if you use your own image.
The application should be working. You can add new TODO item and remove TODO item.

### Step 6: Add a domain name for the website.
