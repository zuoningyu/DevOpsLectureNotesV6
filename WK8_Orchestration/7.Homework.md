# Docker and Orchestration related

* Task 1. Dockerise any web project (e.g. EasyCRM, P3) and push the image to dockerhub 
* Task 2. Use docker-compose to spin up a nginx and the webapp containers. 
* Task 3. Could you use docker swarm to make a few replicas of the webapp and balance the load among them?   
* ( Optional ) If you use EasyCRM, What problem do you see with Task 3? (Hint: stateful vs stateless server)

* Stretch Task: Deploy your app to Kubernetes
* Question 1: Are you able to scale up and down you webapp?
* Question 2: Are you able to roll out a new version (e.g. different tag) of your webapp? What are the steps?
Stretch Question: Are you able to configure the nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer for the webapp?

   (Hints:
   * I. You may need to pick up the nginx knowledge and rewrite the nginx config file to suit the cluster
   * II. How to configure so that your nginx can detect and load balance requests to any new pods?)
