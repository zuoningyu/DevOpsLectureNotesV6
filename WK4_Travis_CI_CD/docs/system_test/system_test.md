# What is system test?

System Testing means testing the system as a whole. All the modules/components are integrated in order to verify if the system works as expected or not.

System Testing is done after Integration Testing. This plays an important role in delivering a high-quality product.


# Focus area
* External interfaces
* Multiprogram and complex functionalities
* Security
* Recovery
* Performance
* Operator and userâ€™s smooth interaction with the system
* Installability
* Documentation
* Usability
* Load/Stress

# More to read
