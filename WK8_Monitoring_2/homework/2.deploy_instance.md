# 2. DEPLOYING AN INSTANCE
## Deploy CloudFormation Template

1.  Download the  [LinuxMachineDeploy.yaml](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Performance/100_Monitoring_Linux_EC2_CloudWatch/Code/LinuxMachineDeploy.yaml)  CloudFormation template to your machine.

2.  Go to the AWS CloudFormation console at  [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)  and click  **Create Stack**  >  **With new resources**[![Images/CFNCreateStackButton](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNCreateStackButton.png)](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNCreateStackButton.png)

3.  Leave  **Prepare template**  setting as-is

    -   For  **Template source**  select  **Upload a template file**
    -   Click  **Choose file**  and supply the CloudFormation template you downloaded:  _LinuxMachineDeploy.yaml_[![CFNUploadTemplateFile](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNUploadTemplateFile.png)](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNUploadTemplateFile.png)
4.  Click  **Next**

5.  For  **Stack name**  use  **LinuxMachineDeploy**

6.  **Parameters**

    -   Look over the Parameters and their default values.

    -   **None of these parameters need to be changed, but are available if you wish to try different settings**

    -   **Stack name**  – Use  **LinuxMachineDeploy**  (case sensitive)

    -   **CloudWatchNameSpace**  - The CloudWatch NameSpace to use instead of the default

    -   **InstanceAMI**  – This will auto-populate with the latest version of the Amazon Linux 2 AMI

    -   **InstanceType**  - Instance Type, defaults to t3.large but can use any size supported by Linux in the region you have chosen


    -   **MetricAggregationInterval**  - How often should the CloudWatch Agent send data into CloudWatch.

    -   **MetricCollectionInterval**  - How often should the CloudWatch Agent collect information from the Operating System.

    -   **PrimaryNodeLabel**  - The additional label assigned to the EC2 instance to use for searching within CloudWatch Explorer. This is done by adding an extra Tag to the EC2 instance.

    -   **VPCImportName**  - The name of the stack you created in the previous step that will be used to launch the instance into.

    -   Click  **Next**

7.  For  **Configure stack options**  we recommend configuring tags, which are key-value pairs, that can help you identify your stacks and the resources they create. For example, enter  _Owner_  in the left column which is the key, and your email address in the right column which is the value. We will not use additional permissions or advanced options so click  **Next**. For more information, see  [Setting AWS CloudFormation Stack Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide//cfn-console-add-tags.html)  .

8.  For  **Review**

    -   Review the contents of the page
    -   At the bottom of the page, select  **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names**
    -   Click  **Create stack**[![CFNIamCapabilities](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNIamCapabilities.png)](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNIamCapabilities.png)
9.  This will take you to the CloudFormation stack status page, showing the stack creation in progress.

    -   Click on the  **Events**  tab
    -   Scroll through the listing. It shows the activities performed by CloudFormation (newest events at top), such as starting to create a resource and then completing the resource creation.
    -   Any errors encountered during the creation of the stack will be listed in this tab.[![StackCreationStarted](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNStackInProgress.png)](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/images/CreateNewCloudFormationStack/CFNStackInProgress.png)
10.  When it shows  **status**  _CREATE_COMPLETE_, then you are finished with this step.


This template will take between  **2-5 minutes**  to fully deploy using a t3.large. A smaller instance size may take longer.
