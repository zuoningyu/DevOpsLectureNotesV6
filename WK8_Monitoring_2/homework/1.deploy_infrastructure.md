# MONITORING AN AMAZON LINUX EC2 INSTANCE WITH CLOUDWATCH DASHBOARDS

## Introduction

This hands-on lab will guide you through creating an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux and then configuring a Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard to get aggregated views of the health and performance information for that instance.

## Costs

-   [https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)
    -   You can create 3 dashboards for up to 50 metrics per month on the free tier and then it is $3.00 per dashboard per month
    -   This lab creates one dashboard, so the maximum cost would be $3.00 per month if you have already consumed the free tier.
-   The default lab uses a t3.large EC2 instance which will consume approximately $3.00 for every day the lab is running
-   The VPC that is created for this lab will build a Nat Gateway, and will consume $5.50 per day when deployed.
-   Using defaults, the total cost of the lab would be at least $8.50 per day. **Please go through the [tear_down_steps](https://github.com/JiangRenDevOps/DevOpsLectureNotesV3/blob/master/WK8_Monitoring_2/homework/6.tear_down.md) immediately after you finish this lab.**

# 1. DEPLOYING THE INFRASTRUCTURE
## Deploy VPC

This step will create the VPC and all components using the example CloudFormation template.

1.  Download the latest version of the CloudFormation template here:  [vpc-alb-app-db.yaml](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/Common/Create_VPC_Stack/Code/vpc-alb-app-db.yaml)
2.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console, select your preferred region, and open the CloudFormation console at  [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)  .
3.  Click  **Create Stack**, then  **With new resources (standard)**.

4.  Click  **Upload a template file**  and then click  **Choose file**.

5.  Choose the CloudFormation template you downloaded in step 1, return to the CloudFormation console page and click  **Next**.
6.  Enter the following details:
    -   **Stack name**: The name of this stack. For this lab, use  **PerfLab-VPC**  and match the case.
    -   **Parameters**: Parameters may be left as defaults, you can find out more in the description for each.

7.  At the bottom of the page click  **Next**.
8.  In this lab, we use tags, which are key-value pairs, that can help you identify your stacks. Enter  _Owner_  in the left column which is the key, and your email address in the right column which is the value. We will not use additional permissions or advanced options so click  **Next**. For more information, see  [Setting AWS CloudFormation Stack Options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide//cfn-console-add-tags.html)  .
9.  Review the information for the stack. When youâ€™re satisfied with the configuration, at the bottom of the page check  **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names**  then click  **Create stack**.

10.  After a few minutes the final stack status should change from  _CREATE_IN_PROGRESS_  to  _CREATE_COMPLETE_. You can click the  **refresh**  button to check on the current status. You have now created the VPC stack (well actually CloudFormation did it for you).

11.  When the stack status is  _CREATE_COMPLETE_, you can continue to the next step.
