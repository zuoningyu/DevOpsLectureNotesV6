## 6. Spin up grafana
Follow these steps to spin up webapp, prometheus and grafana
```
cd flask_statsd_prometheus
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-infra.yml up
```
Go to `localhost:3000` and go to Alerting -> Notification Channels
![Alt text](../images/notification_channel.png?raw=true)

Copy paste the API key and API URL in step 5 to here
And give it a name: `JiangRenMainAlert` (You can name it whatever you like)
![Alt text](../images/notification_channel_config.png?raw=true)
Save and test


## 7. Create a dashboard and a chart
Let us create a new dashboard and name it WebApp

Let us add a panel and name it WebApp Error Rate

Make sure it selected prometheus as source of data

To calculate the error rate, we need to calculate (total errors in X min/ total requests in X min)

Therefore, 
```
sum (rate(request_count{status="500"}[15s])) / sum (rate(request_count[15s]))
```

![Alt text](../images/query.png?raw=true)

We should have generated enough data on `localhost:5000/test` and `localhost:5000/test1` from the previous steps

## 8. Configure alert for the chart
Let us evaluate this alert every 15 seconds for 1 minute
And set a condition that if the value is above 0.5 (50%) for 10s then alert
![Alt text](../images/alert_1.png?raw=true)

![Alt text](../images/alert.png?raw=true)

Save and hit `localhost:5000/test1`

Do you receive an alert on your phone?

I have got a phone call, an email and a message in the OpsGenie portal
![Alt text](../images/triggered_alert.png?raw=true)
If you have OpsGenie App, it can also push notifications.

## 9. Other configs
Currently, the alert is a default alert. Of course, you could customise for you and your team.
To adjust the notification order or time, go to settings -> notification and configure the change alerts here 
![Alt text](../images/notif_config.png?raw=true)

For a team schedule, go to Teams -> <Your Team> -> On-call. Try to invite a classmate and schedule an on-call for him/her
![Alt text](../images/team_schedule.png?raw=true)

For any change that is made for the team, you can track the logs here:
![Alt text](../images/team_log.png?raw=true)
