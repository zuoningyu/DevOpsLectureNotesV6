## Traditional logging 
### Linux/Unix
One of the most important logs contained within /var/log is syslog. This particular log file logs everything except auth-related messages. Say you want to view the contents of that particular log file. To do that, you could quickly issue the command less /var/log/syslog. This command will open the syslog log file to the top. You can then use the arrow keys to scroll down one line at a time, the spacebar to scroll down one page at a time, or the mouse wheel to easily scroll through the file.

```
/var/log
```
or

```
tail -f  /var/log/syslog
```

The dmesg command prints the kernel ring buffer. By default, the command will display all messages from the kernel ring buffer. From the terminal window, issue the command dmesg and the entire kernel ring buffer will print out.
```
dmesg | less
```

### Application
![Alt text](./images/linear_log.png?raw=true)

##Why log?
Analyse business metrics (e.g. DAU, MAU, SLI, Customer Behavior etc)

Identify security threats (e.g. to find out and block the attacker's source IP and user agent)

Trouble shooting
* Identify bugs and errors (e.g. application bugs/errors vs system bugs/errors)
* Incident Investigation 

##Challenges
Tens of thousands of lines are generated per minute for a software like us. The traditional logs exploring is not gonna work.


##Logging as a service

__Logging as a service (LaaS)__ is an IT architectural model for centrally ingesting and collecting any type of log files coming from any given source or location; such as servers, applications, devices etc. The files are "normalized" or filtered for reformatting and forwarding to other dependent systems to be processed as “native” data, which can then be managed, displayed and ultimately disposed of according to a predesignated retention schedule based on any number of criteria.

In an enterprise situation, the IT datacenter becomes the hub for all log files and normalization. In a managed service provider (MSP) environment, the log sources would be coming from applications outside the enterprise but still hosted and managed by the MSP as needed.

Under this model, the IT datacenter acts as the "private cloud" under the concept of cloud computing to provision the logs to various stakeholders within the organization for future forensics or analysis to identify risks, patterns of activity or predict behaviors based on the data collected within the logs. Just as IT becomes the "hub" of the service, the stakeholders become the beneficiaries of the centralized data in the form of alerts, reports or any periphery applications for predictive analysis or insight from big data through graphical display.

##What to log?

### Authentication, Authorization, and Access:
These events include things such as 
- successful and failed authentication
- authorizations 
- system access 
- data access
- application access.

Example of Authentication logs:
 - TIMESTAMP
 - ACCESS_METHOD
 - STATUS_CODE
 - RESPONSE_TIME
 
Example of Authorization logs:
 - User ID
 - Role
 - Authorized

Example of Nginx access logs:
 - TIMESTAMP
 - SOURCE_IP
 - URL
 - HTTP_USER_AGENT
 - STATUS_CODE
 - URL_PATH
 - RESPONSE_TIME
 
 

 
### Changes

These events include changes to systems or applications, changes to data (creation and destruction) and application installation and changes.

Example of changes to systems
* os image version update
* network/interface update
* kernel update

Example of changes to applications 
* application image version update
* application components update

Example of changes to data
* column update
* data upgrade

### Availability

Availability events include startup and shutdown of systems and applications, faults and errors that affect application availability and backup successes and failures.

Example of availability events
* healthcheck
* startup/shutdown system logs
* startup/shutdown component logs
* startup/shutdown application logs
* cronman job/backup failures or errors

### Resource 

Resource issues to log include exhausted resources, exceeded capacities and connectivity issues.

Example of resource logs
* exhausted threads/connections of each component (e.g. EC2, Docker, RDS etc...)
* exhausted cpu/disk/memory log (better to auto trigger threaddump, heapdump, flamechart or other info) 
* over capacity queues

### Threats

Some common threats to logs include invalid inputs and security issues known to affect the application.

* Hacker input
* Common User Behaviour

## Nginx logs

Let us firstly create a folder and two files for logging
```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/logs
sudo touch /usr/share/nginx/logs/error.log
sudo touch /usr/share/nginx/logs/access.log
```
My default folder is under `/usr/share/nginx/`, you can check yours by running
```
nginx -V
```
and see what is under `--prefix`

Now, Let us check what is the new in nginx.conf

Let us replace the nginx.conf 
```
cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Restart nginx
```
sudo systemctl reload nginx 
```


Try access now; 

```
localhost:8081
```

You should see a 502 error, because we haven't set up the app yet

```
cd ../WK4_WebApp_Basics
python3 app.py
```
try access few endpoints now
```
localhost:8081/abc
localhost:8081/upload
localhost:8081/signin
localhost:8081/signup
localhost:8081/login
```
Now let us check the logs
```
less /usr/share/nginx/logs/error.log
less /usr/share/nginx/logs/access.log
```
oh, by the way, don't forget to check
```
tail -f  /var/log/syslog
```

## Fluentd
Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files, RDBMS, NoSQL, IaaS, SaaS, Hadoop and so on. Fluentd helps you unify your logging infrastructure (Learn more about the Unified Logging Layer).

An event consists of tag, time and record. Tag is a string separated with '.' (e.g. myapp.access). It is used to categorize events. Time is a UNIX time recorded at occurrence of an event. Record is a JSON object.

### Use case
* Centralizing Apache/Nginx Server Logs
* Syslog Alerting	
* Mobile/Web Application Logging


### Installation
Install ruby
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

Install fluentd https://github.com/fluent/fluentd
```
$ gem install fluentd
$ fluentd -s conf
$ fluentd -c conf/fluent.conf &
$ echo '{"json":"message"}' | fluent-cat debug.test
```
![Alt text](./images/fluentd-architecture.png?raw=true)

Install fluentd-ui https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-ui

You may need to use `sudo`
```
$ gem install fluentd-ui
$ fluentd-ui setup
$ fluentd-ui start --daemonize
```
The default account is username="admin" and password="changeme".

### Collect logs

Now, let us install a multiline parser and hook the nginx logs to fluentd
```
fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-multi-format-parser
```
https://docs.fluentd.org/parser/nginx
```
cp fluent.conf /conf/fluent.conf
sudo pkill -f fluentd
fluentd -c conf/fluent.conf -vv &
```
Try hit the endpoints again.

#### Homework
In `nginx.conf`, use the following to log the message:
```
    log_format   main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
                      '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent"';
    access_log   logs/access.log  main;
```

How would you configure fluent.conf to print out the following message?
```
time:
1362020400 (28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900)

record:
{
  "remote" : "127.0.0.1",
  "host"   : "192.168.0.1",
  "user"   : "-",
  "method" : "GET",
  "path"   : "/",
  "code"   : "200",
  "size"   : "777",
  "referer": "-",
  "agent"  : "Opera/12.0"
}
```
